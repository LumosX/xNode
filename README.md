For information on xNode, releases, and other things, check out the [parent repo](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode) instead.

### Stuff?
I merge things I use into the [personal-use](https://github.com/LumosX/xNode/tree/personal-use) branch, even if they haven't been pull-requested into the parent repo. If you do want to use this fork, that'd be your best bet.
